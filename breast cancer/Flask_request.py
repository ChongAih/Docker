# # Flask
# 
# 1. Setting up API for model using flask will trigger a warning - "This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.". It is due to the setting of Flask supporting only a single thread which is not able to support high volume of requests. For more production deployment, gunicorn (in linux) or waitress module to support multiple threads.

# Create logging for debugging

                   format='%(asctime)s %(name)s %(threadName)s: %(message)s')

logging.info('Pipeline loaded and flask app started.')

# Create an API GET endpoint: can be access from internet surfer
@app.route('/predict', methods=['GET']) # Name the api and declare the method

    # Read the request data
    x_test = request.args.get('x_test')
    
    # Convert from json to original format (list) to pipeline required format (numpy array)
    x_test = np.array(json.loads(x_test))
    
    # Prediction
    y_pred = pipeline.predict(x_test)
    y_pred = 'No' if y_pred < 0.5 else 'Yes'
    
    logging.info('Prediction made.')
    
    return 'Breast Cancer Prediction: {}'.format(y_pred)
